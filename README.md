# Webstrike-phila
A detailed forensic analysis of the WebStrike blue team lab from CyberDefenders, focusing on investigating a web server compromise through network traffic analysis. This repository documents my systematic approach to identifying attacker techniques, analyzing malicious activity, and extracting critical indicators of compromise from PCAP files.

# 🎯 Learning Objectives
Through this investigation, I aimed to build and demonstrate competency in:

Network Traffic Analysis: Using Wireshark to filter and inspect malicious packets.

Attack Chain Reconstruction: Chronologically mapping the stages of a cyber attack.

Indicator of Compromise (IOC) Extraction: Identifying key forensic artifacts (IPs, hashes, filenames).

Professional Documentation: Creating clear, actionable reports for stakeholders.

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping: Aligning attacker techniques to a standardized framework.
